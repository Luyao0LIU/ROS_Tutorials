## Pre-build Setup#
## Build Unreal Engine
Make sure you are registered with Epic Games. This is required to get source code access for Unreal Engine.
Clone Unreal in your favorite folder and build it (this may take a while!). Note: We only support Unreal >= 4.27 at present. We recommend using 4.27.
```bash
# go to the folder where you clone GitHub projects
git clone -b 4.27 git@github.com:EpicGames/UnrealEngine.git
cd UnrealEngine
./Setup.sh
./GenerateProjectFiles.sh
make
```
## Build AirSim
Clone AirSim 1.8v and build it:
```bash
# go to the folder where you clone GitHub projects
git clone -b v1.8.0-linux https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim.git
cd AirSim
```
By default AirSim uses clang 8 to build for compatibility with UE 4.27. The setup script will install the right version of cmake, llvm, and eigen.
```bash
./setup.sh
./build.sh
# use ./build.sh --debug to build in debug mode
```
